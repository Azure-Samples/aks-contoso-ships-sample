### Installation & Quickstart

#### Running with Docker

Just type `docker-compose up` on the project root and it should start a working application.

#### Running stand alone

The application is divided into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend` each one with their respective codes and infrastructure files.

__Front End__: Created using Vim. Just go into the directory, type `npm install` to install all dependencies and then `npm run serve`. You can also build the image from the Dockerfile in the same directory

__Front End__: Created with TypeScript. Just go into the directory, type `npm install` to install all dependencies and then `npm run build:start` to run the app or `npm run start:debug` to start in debug mode (tsc watch and logging). You can also build the image from the Dockerfile in the same directory
